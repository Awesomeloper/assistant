# MudPi Setup Assistant
> A web application with setup scripts to make first time configurations in MudPi.

MudPi Assistant is a lightweight php application that helps with first time configurations like connecting to Wifi. This is generally useful for non-developers that want a friendly interface for initial configurations. MudPi Assistant can be installed through the installer or manually by downloading the repo into your web server root and adding the appropriate server configurations. A sample nginx config is provided at `configs/mudpi_assistant.conf`. This application is quite useful in combination with an access point.
